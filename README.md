ABOUT
=====

A lightweight social-app. inspired by politikana, this app will 
be used for social activitists/activitism. 

In the future i would like to learn more about its social aspect and use
something like neo4j. 

This is my first 'real' app using python, so consider that when peeking
through the code :p. upcoming updates will be posted in 
https://twitter.com/peduli_dev

so far, i really like tornado's templating, locale, and simplicity :)
